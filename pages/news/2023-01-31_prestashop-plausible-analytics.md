## Goodbye Google Analytics ðŸ¤—

Plausible is one of the alternatives to Google Analytics.

We like this solution for the following points:

- Lightweight script  (< 1 KB)
- Open source project
- No need for cookie banners or GDPR consent
- Track events, goal conversions and campaigns
- A clear interface

We have developed a Prestashop module to implement Plausible.

The module adds the following features:

- Plausible Statistic visible on Prestashop admin interface
- Includes goal events when enabled in module configuration: Contact message sent, Cart view, Checkout step X, Order complete
- Add a custom goal


Many thanks to **Magentix** for developing the module.
