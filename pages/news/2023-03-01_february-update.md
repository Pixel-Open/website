February is the shortest month of the year and yet it was intense for the development of our Open Source projects.

We have had community feedback on bug fixes or improvements via features.

Below is a list of activity for our various Open Source projects.

## Add a custom template for the display of Widgets for the Prestashop Google My Business module ðŸ¤—

We have launched version 1.0.3 for the Google My Business module for Prestashop which allows you to define a personalized template to display, for example, the overall rating.

The documentation has been updated with an example of this new feature (https://github.com/Pixel-Open/prestashop-googlemybusiness#custom-template)

You can download this version here: https://github.com/Pixel-Open/prestashop-googlemybusiness/releases/tag/1.0.3
