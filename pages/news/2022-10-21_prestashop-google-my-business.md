Automatically retrieve your business information from Google My Business : schedules, reviews...

<!-- break -->

## Your Google My Business page to your Prestashop

We have developed an open source module that allows you to retrieve certain information from Google My Business:

- Your business hours
- The reviews of your customers
- The average rating of your company

Recovery is launched with a command (symfony) which allows information to be recovered periodically.

The module requires that **you can have API keys for Google Places**.

**You must have an advanced technical level to use this module** (know how to launch an order, manage Google APIs, manage html/css layout)

You can see the project here: https://github.com/Pixel-Open/prestashop-googlemybusiness

Many thanks to Magentix for developing the module.
