Sharing our open source projects through a dedicated site, here is the objective of this site. We will also publish news about our projects or technical articles.

## Static is basic üíó

To develop this site, we want to go back to basics: **a static site**.

The site was created with the static site generator: [Cecil](https://cecil.app)

It's not the most popular but we liked its simplicity and functionality (and its developer is very nice!).

You can see the site's source code here: https://github.com/Pixel-Open/website

We use Cloudflare Page for site hosting.

## No GAFAM, it's good for our minds and our planet üåç

No Google Analytics, no GDPR modal, no Facebook or Twitter highlighting, no webmarketing, the web before 2004 üëæ

This saves performance, no heavy script to load!

And this performance has an environmental impact, a report shows it: https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/pixel-open-org/

We will be making improvements soon:

- Presentation of contributors
- And other surprises


We wish you good surfing on this site,

The Pixel Open Team
