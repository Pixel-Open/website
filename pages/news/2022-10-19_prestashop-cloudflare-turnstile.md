Cloudflare Turnstile protects your forms from spammers. We have developed a module to integrate it into the different Prestashop forms.
<!-- break -->

## Bye bye bots ü§ñ

Cloudflare recently announced an alternative to **Google reCaptcha** that offers a different approach.

Without going into details, **[a post explains in detail the new approach](https://blog.cloudflare.com/turnstile-private-captcha-alternative/)**.

We decided to develop an open source module for Prestashop in order to implement this new service.

The project is visible **[on Github](https://github.com/Pixel-Open/prestashop-cloudflare-turnstile)**

**The implementation of the module requires technical notions, it is necessary to read the readme.**

üëç Small bonus, you can implement Turnstile on custom Prestashop forms with good technical knowledge (see also the readme)

Many thanks to **Magentix** for developing the module.
